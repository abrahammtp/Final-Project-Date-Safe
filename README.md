# Date Safe

Going on first dates is always a nerve wracking experience. There are so nany unknowns and so many things to be wary of. Date Safe is here to help with that. Let us worry for you so you can enjoy yourself!

## Concept

Just imagine this: you are going on a date with someone you don't know yet. Sounds exciting, right? But it can also be scary and nerve wracking! Date Safe is a MERN stack application that allows you to fill out the details of your date, where you're going, who you're going with, and a description! You can create your own account so the information is always going to be secure.

You can find the deployed application here
